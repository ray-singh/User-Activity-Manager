# Simple-Authentication-System
This project provides an implementation of a hash table in Python, featuring separate chaining for collision resolution. The HashTable class supports typical hash table operations such as insertion, deletion, and lookup. Developed as a part of a learning excercise in data structures and algorithms, this simple authentication system prioritizes speed over security. It draws inspiration from Okta, a leading identity and access management service. 

Features:
- Dynamic Resizing: The hash table automatically resizes when the load factor exceeds a certain threshold.
- Custom Hash Functions: Two hash functions are used to reduce collisions.
- Type Annotations: The implementation includes type annotations for better code clarity and type checking.
- Deleted Nodes Handling: Deleted nodes are marked and managed to maintain efficient use of space.
